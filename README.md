<h1>PHP and MySQL CRUD Operations</h1>
Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using PHP and MySQL. CRUD operations are fundamental in web development, allowing users to interact with a database through a web application. In this project, we've built a simple web application that showcases these operations.

<h2>Feature:</h2>
<h3>Create (C)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Users can add new records to the database.</li>
  <li>A user-friendly form collects data and inserts it into the MySQL database.</li>
  <li>Data validation ensures the integrity of the database.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Read (R)</h3>
Users can view existing records from the database.
Data is presented in a clear and organized manner for easy access.
Pagination and search functionality enhance the user experience.
<h3>Update (U)</h3>
Users can modify and update existing records.
An intuitive interface allows users to edit specific fields.
Changes are reflected in real-time within the database.
<h3>Delete (D)</h3>
Users can remove records from the database securely.
Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental deletions.
Deleted data can be restored only by re-adding it.
<h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
PHP: The server-side scripting language for handling requests and database operations.
MySQL: A robust relational database management system for data storage.
HTML/CSS: The foundation for creating a user-friendly interface.
Bootstrap: Enhances the application's aesthetics and responsiveness.
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
